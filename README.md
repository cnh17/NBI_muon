# NBI_muon

This is a log of my analysis steps made in the virtual box on my computer.

14/08/19
- First Commit : Working code for producing histogram of invariant mass.
- Run over all events : Now includes all 680760 events in tree mini;3.
- Cleaned up code : cleaner for loop in calculating momentum.

15/08/19
- Second Commit : histograms made for both e and muons so easier to run codes with different dominant lepton eg. just change source of data and leave the rest of the code.
  - Sources: DataMuons.root & DataEgamma.root

16/08/19
- Third Commit : Also considers missing transverse energy of neutrinos.
